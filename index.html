                            I was born in Athens, GA in 1991 where I would spend my first 18 years and graduate from Clarke Central High School. Soon after, I moved to
                             Atlanta to attend Georgia Tech and in 2014 was able to complete my bachelors degree in Business Administration. Ever since, I have been working in 
                             Norcross for CentricsIT where I price maintenance contracts to repair enterprise hardware, such as servers, storage, or networking devices. I 
                             have always had an interest in new technologies, and while in school at Georgia Tech I was able to build my own computer. A hobby in computer 
                             hardware is what helped me land my job at CentricsIT, and learning more about the software side became a goal of mine. Enrolling in the Georgia Tech 
                             Coding Boot Camp was not only a means to complete that goal, but also a way to enhance my proffesional career and add a valuable skill set to my resume.
